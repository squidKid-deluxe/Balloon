# Balloon game
-----------------------------

The balloon game is a fairly simple game, with only 200 lines of code.

### How to play:
1. To run the game by first type
   `cd ~/<the directory of the game>`
   into your terminal window. Then, type
   `python3 balloon.py`.

2. To play the game, use the left and right arrow keys to manuver the hot air balloon around the rapidly firing bullet bills. Every time a bullet goes off the screen(aka. successfully avoided), you get one point. Once a bullet hits you and your balloon pops, your final score is displayed, along with a 'GAME OVER' message and a comment on how good you did.
